# Project SM

'SM' stand for Shock Me, without context it make no sence. But it's a bad idea coming to reality.

It a project that shock the user (or the masochist) that will be wearing a shock collor. The shock request will send through a website and to rasberry Pi (or whatever device is used.)

Some form of electrical engineering, the shock collor's remote connect to the rasberry Pi(or whatever device is used.) with a relay.

And for everyone who will be making this. Please try to be safe.


Python is used for the backend and control of the shock collor.

> ps. The project is not currently completed as of yet, you can look at progress in the steps.txt file.
